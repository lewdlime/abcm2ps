			Format parameters
			=================

The general layout of the printed scores may be changed in four ways:
	1- at compilation time setting the values in abc2ps.h,
	2- at running time in a 'format' file,
	3- at startup time in the command line,
	4- by pseudo-comments inside the tunes.

For more about 3), have a look at options.txt.

A format file contains lines giving the parameters values, format:

	parameter [parameter list]

In a format file, empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

The pseudo-comments used for formatting have the format:

	%%parameter [parameter list]

Format parameters may appear in the command line by:

	--parameter [parameter list]

Some pseudo-comments are treated while being parsed and cannot appear
in a format file nor in the command line. These ones are listed at the
end of this file.

		   in next releases and asks for a good knowledge of the
		   internals of abcm2ps - see deco.abc for examples !!
		The actual arguments are:
		<name>: name of the decoration. If it is the name of an
			existing decoration, this one is redefined.
		<c_func>: index of a C function (defined in deco.c).
			The possible values are:
			0, 1, 2: decoration near the note, inside the staff.
				0: 'dot' and 'tenuto'

	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -L<int>

			iso-8859-3	(latin3)
			iso-8859-4	(latin4)
			iso-8859-9	(latin5)
			iso-8859-10	(latin6)
			native
		When the encoding is 'native', the encoding vectors
		of the fonts are not changed.
		<encoding> may be any string. In this case, the encoding
		vector must be defined by a sequence of 'postscript'
		commands.
		<int> may take values from '0' to '6'.

		encoding vector for Latin1 is not output.

		Draw the expression decorations above the staff.
		If neither 'exprabove' nor 'exprbelow' are true, the
		expression decorations are drawn above the staff if
		there are lyrics on the staff, and below otherwise.
		'exprabove' takes precedence over 'exprbelow'.

  exprbelow <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Draw the expression decorations below the staff.
		If neither 'exprabove' nor 'exprbelow' are true, the
		expression decorations are drawn above the staff if
		there are lyrics on the staff, and below otherwise.
		'exprabove' takes precedence over 'exprbelow'.

  flatbeams <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -f
	Description:
		Have flat beams in bagpipe tunes.

  font <font> [<encoding>]
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define a font and its encoding.
		This parameter is required when specific fonts are
		defined later in ABC files/tunes, and it must be defined
		before any PostScript output is done, generally in a
		format file.
		When absent, <encoding> defaults to the current
		'encoding' parameter (see above).

  footer <text>
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define the text printed at the bottom of each page.
		There may be one or two lines. When 2 lines, these
		ones must be separated by the 2 characters "\n" (not
		a real 'newline').
		In each lines 3 areas may be defined: left, center and
		right.
		These areas are separated by tabulations (real TABs,
		not '\t') and may be empty (if the left area is empty,
		quote the string - see sample3.abc for example).
		The character '$' introduces variable expansion:
			- '$d' is the date and time of the last modification
			   of the current ABC input file,
			- '$D' is the current date and time,
			- '$F' is the current input file name,
			- '$P' is the current page number,
			- '$P0' and '$P1' are also the page number, but only
			   when this one is even ('0') or odd ('1'),
			- '$T' is the current tune title,
			- '$V' is 'abcm2ps-' followed by the program version.
		For example, the command line option '-N3' is the same
		as:
			%%header "$P0		$P1"
		(note the 2 TABs).
		A little trick: when a header or footer is defined inside
		a tune, it is printed on the next page. This may be used
		for example to have no header/footer on the 1st page.

  footerfont <font> [<encoding>] <size>

List of the pseudo-comments treated while parsed
------------------------------------------------

  begintext [<option>]
	Start printing a free text. The text appears on the next lines
	(starting with '%%' or not). The text ends on a line containing
		%%endtext
	<option> may be:
	    'obeylines':	  keep lines as they are (default)
	    'align' or 'justify': justify the lines
	    'ragged' or 'fill':	  fill the lines
	    'center':		  center the lines
	    'skip':		  don't print the lines (same as comments)

  center <line of text>
	Print one line of centered text.

  EPS <eps_file>
	Include the file <eps_file>.

  endtext
	See 'begintext'.

  multicol <command>
	Define multicolomn printing.
	<command> may be:
	    'start':	save the current vertical position and the left
			and right margins. Then, these margins may
			be changed to print music or text.
	    'new':	reset the vertical offset at the place of the
			previous '%%multicol start', and restore the left
			and right margins.
	    'end':	restore the left and right margins, and skip down
			to a safe place.
	(see 'sample3.abc' for example).

  newpage [<int>]
	Continue printing on a new page and possibly restart page
	numbering from <int>.

  repbra <bool>
	The repeat brackets are normally displayed as found in a voice.
	'%%repbra 0' prevents displaying them for the current voice.

  sep [<h1> <h2> <len>]
	Print a separator of length <len> with space <h1> above and
	space <h2> below (defaults: h1 = h2 = 0.5cm, len = 3.0cm).

  setbarnb <int>
	Set the number of the next measure to <int>.
	When found outside a tune, this command is the same as
	'%%measurefirst'. If it appears at the beginning of the tune
	(after K:), only the 2nd measure will have the new number.

  staff <["+" | "-"] int>
	Put the next symbols of the current voice on the staff <int>
	(1..n - see sample4.abc for example), or on the <+int>th or
	<-int>th staff.

  staffbreak <unit>
	Have a break in the current staff. <unit> gives the width of the
	break (in points, inches or cm). As a side effect, when the width
	is bigger than 0.5 cm, the left side of the staff system is redrawn.
	When used in a multi-voice tune, a staff break must be inserted
	in each voice.

  staves <definition>
	See 'features.txt' for description.

  text <line of text>
	Print one line of text.

  vskip <h>
	Skip vertical space of height <h>.
