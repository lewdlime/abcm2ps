			Format parameters
			=================

The general layout of the printed scores may be changed in four ways:
	1- at compilation time setting the values in abc2ps.h,
	2- at running time in a 'format' file,
	3- at startup time in the command line,
	4- by pseudo-comments inside the tunes.

For more about 3), have a look at options.txt.

A format file contains lines giving the parameters values, format:

	parameter [parameter list]

In a format file, empty lines and lines starting with '%' are ignored.

The pseudo-comments used for formatting have the format:

	%%parameter [parameter list]

Format parameters may appear in the command line as:

	--parameter [parameter list]

The keyword "lock" may appear at the end of the parameter list, in
which case, the parameter will not be settable anymore (except with
"lock" again). It is implicitly added in the command line parameters.

Some pseudo-comments are treated while being parsed and cannot appear
in a format file nor in the command line. These ones are listed at the
end of this file.

In font definitions, <font>, <encoding> and <size> may be specified
as '*' (star), in which case the font, encoding or size remains
the same. When the <encoding> is omitted, it defaults to 'utf-8'
or to the last 'font' definition of the same font. The <encoding> values
are described in 'annotationfont'.


List of the format parameters
-----------------------------

  abc2pscompat <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -u
	Description:
		When true, set 'M' as the +tenuto+ decoration and do a
		pitch translation for the bass and alto clefs.

  alignbars <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Align the bars of the next <int> music lines.
		Such an alignment works only when there is only one
		voice in each music line (no V:, %%staves or %%score
		is allowed).

  aligncomposer <int>
	Default: 1
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Tell where to display the composer field.
		A negative value means 'on the left', 0 means 'center',
		and a positive value means 'on the right'.
			

  annotationfont <font> [<encoding>] [<size>]
	Default: Helvetica 12
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Set the annotation font to <font> with a size <size>.
		When present, <encoding> may be either 'us-ascii', 'utf-8'
		or 'native'. It is used only for PostScript output without
		pango. When the <encoding> is not 'native', a PostScript
		convertion table is build to handle most latin characters.
		It may be extended to handle more characters, but a good
		PostScript knowledge is required (see the file sample.abc).

  autoclef <bool>
	Default: 1
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		When true, set the clefs and possibly insert clef
		changes when no clef is defined in K: or V:.

	Same as 'measurenb'.

  barsperstaff <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -B<int>
	Description:

		Each line between 'beginps' and 'endps' is included in
		the PostScript output file.
		Such a sequence cannot be greater than 128 Kb.
		When the output file format is SVG (command options '-g',
		'-v' or '-X'), the PostScript code is executed by the
		small abcm2ps PS interpreter. Sequences which cannot
		be executed (as font redefinitions) must be skipped
		checking the presence of the symbol 'svg':

		/svg where {pop} {
		.. PostScript code which cannot be executed by abcm2ps ..
		} ifelse

  beginsvg
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Start a SVG sequence which ends on 'endsvg'.
		This parameter may be found only in a format or a ABC

		It is ignored when the SVG generation is started (as
		after the first K: information field).

  bgcolor <color>
	Default: none
	Compilation: none

	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		When 'combinevoices' is set, voice combination does not

		Define a decoration.
		!! this is an experimental feature which is subject to change
		   in next releases and asks for a good knowledge of the
		   internals of abcm2ps - see deco.abc for examples !!
		The actual arguments are:
		<name>: name of the decoration. If it is the name of an

	Description:
		When true, horizontally align the dynamic marks.

  dynamic <int>
	Default: 0

				the presence and position of lyrics)
			1 or 'above' above the staff
			2 or 'below' below the staff
		When this parameter appears outside a tune or inside a tune
		header, it applies to all voices. When inside a tune body,
		it applies to the current voice only.
		This parameter may also be set by the parameter 'dyn='
		of the V: information field.

  encoding <charset encoding> | <int>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:

  flatbeams <bool>
	Default: 0
	Compilation: none
	Command line: -f
	Description:
		Draw flat beams.

  font <font> [[<encoding>] scale]
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define a font and its encoding.
		This parameter is required with PostScript output when
		specific fonts are defined later in ABC files/tunes.
		It must be defined before any PostScript output is done,
		generally in a format file.
		When absent, <encoding> defaults to the current
		'encoding' parameter (see above).
		<scale> is the width factor to apply to the Time-Roman
		character width. It is needed to adjust the string width
		in case the computation with the default scale gives
		erroneous values (if string clash, set <scale> lower than 1.0
		- if too much space, set it greater than 1.0).

  footer <text>
	Default: none
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:
		Define the text printed at the bottom of each page.
		There may be one or two lines. When 2 lines, these
		ones must be separated by the 2 characters "\n" (not
		a real 'newline').
		In each lines 3 areas may be defined: left, center and
		right.
		These areas are separated by tabulations (real TABs,
		not "\t") and may be empty (if the left area is empty,
		double quote the string - see sample3.abc for example).
		The character '$' introduces variable expansion:
			- '$d' is the date and time of the last modification
			   of the current ABC input file,
			- '$D' is the current date and time,
			- '$F' is the current input file name,
			- '$Ix' is any header information type ('x' is a
			   letter range 'A' to 'Z').
			- '$P' is the current page number,
			- '$P0' and '$P1' are also the page number, but only
			   when this one is even ('0') or odd ('1'),
			- '$T' is the current tune title,
			- '$V' is 'abcm2ps-' followed by the program version.
		For example, the command line option '-N3' is the same
		as:
			%%header "$P0		$P1"
		(note the 2 TABs).
		If the footer (or header) begins with '-' (hyphen/minus),
		it is not printed on the first page.

  footerfont <font> [<encoding>] [<size>]

  notespacingfactor <float>
	Default: 1.414
	Compilation: none
	Command line: none
	Description:

		are not used.
		The format is a set of letters, numbers, commas and
		plus and minus signs. Unrecognized characters are ignored.

		A letter gives the ABC header information type. It may be any
		type range 'A' to 'Z', but 'I', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'U' and 'V'.

		Alignment is defined by a number and/or a minus sign
		following the letter. It may be:
			'0' for 'center',
			'1' for 'right align'
			'-1' (or '-') for 'left align'.
		When absent, alignment defaults to center ('0').

		A plus sign ('+') may appear between two fields
		in which case these fields are concatenated (this works
		only with fields of the same type and same alignment).

		A comma defines a box edge. In each box, the fields are
		vertically added in their alignment zones.

		Example:
			%%titleformat R-1 P-1 Q-1 T C1 O1 , T + T N1
		displays:
		- in the 1st box:
		    - on the left: the rhythm, part and tempo
		    - in the middle: the main title (only)
		    - on the right: the composer and origin
		- in the 2nd box:

List of the pseudo-comments treated while parsed
------------------------------------------------

  begintext [<option>]
	Start printing a free text. The text appears on the next lines
	(starting with '%%' or not). The text ends on a line containing
		%%endtext
	<option> may be:
	    'obeylines':	  keep lines as they are (default)
	    'align' or 'justify': justify the lines
	    'ragged' or 'fill':	  fill the lines
	    'center':		  center the lines
	    'skip':		  don't print the lines (same as comments)
	    'right':		  align at the right side
	When <option> is omitted, it defaults to the %%textoption value.
	Inside the free text, an empty line starts a new paragraph.
	Page breaks (start of new pages) cannot occur in the middle of
	a paragraph.

  center <line of text>
	Print one line of centered text.

  EPS <eps_file>
	Include the file <eps_file>.
	The file content is left or right aligned or centered according
	to the current value of '%%textoption'.

  endtext
	See 'begintext'.

  multicol <command>
	Define multicolomn printing.
	<command> may be:
	    'start':	save the current vertical position and the left
			and right margins. Then, these margins may
			be changed to print music or text.
	    'new':	reset the vertical offset at the place of the
			previous '%%multicol start', and restore the left
			and right margins.
	    'end':	restore the left and right margins, and skip down
			to a safe place.
	(see 'sample3.abc' for example).
	This command may also be used to group some tunes and text in a
	same page.

  newpage [<int>]
	Continue printing on a new page and possibly restart page
	numbering from <int>.

  repbra <bool>
	The repeat brackets are normally displayed as found in a voice.
	'%%repbra 0' prevents displaying them for the current voice.

  repeat [<n> [k]]
	Try to replace a sequence by one or many repeat signs.
	When placed after a bar, <n> indicates the number of measures
	to be repeated. It may be only one or two. If <n> is one,
	<k> indicates how many times the previous measure is to be
	repeated. If <n> is two, <k> is not used.
	When placed after a note or rest, <n> indicates the number of
	notes and rests to be repeated, and <k> how many times this
	repetition occurs.
	When omitted, <n> and <k> default to 1.
	No check is done on the equality of the sequences.
	See 'sample5.abc' for examples.

  score <definition>
	See the ABC standard version 2.0 for description.

  sep [<h1> <h2> <len>]
	Print a separator (centered line) of length <len> with
	space <h1> above and space <h2> below (defaults: h1 = h2 = 0.5cm,
	len = 3.0cm).

  setbarnb <int>
	Set the number of the next measure to <int>.
	When found outside a tune, this command is the same as
	'%%measurefirst'. If it appears at the beginning of the tune
	(after K:), only the 2nd measure will have the new number.

  staff <["+" | "-"] int>
	Put the next symbols of the current voice on the staff <int>
	(1..n - see sample4.abc for example), or on the <+int>th or
	<-int>th staff.

  staffbreak <unit> ["f"]
	Have a break in the current staff. <unit> gives the width of the
	break (in points, inches or cm). As a side effect, when the width
	is bigger than 0.5 cm, the left side of the staff system is redrawn.
	When used in a multi-voice tune, a staff break must be inserted
	in each voice.
	When "f" is not present, the staff break is removed if it occurs
	at start or end of line.

  staves <definition>
	See 'features.txt' for description.

  tablature [#<int>] [pitch=<pitch>] [[<unit-1>] <unit-2>] <unit-3> \
			<head-func> <note-func> [<bar-func>]
	Define a tablature for the current voice.

	Arguments:
		<int> gives the tablature number (from 1 to 8, default=1).
		<pitch> is the pitch of the instrument. It looks like
			a normal ABC note. When present, the pitch of
			each note is given to the note function.
			When absent, the information about the note(s)
			is given by one or many lyrics (w:).
		<unit-1> gives the width of the header (left side of
			the music line).
		<unit-2> gives the tablature height above the staff.
		<unit-3> gives the tablature height under the staff.
		<head-func> is the PostScript function called at start
			of a new music line.
		<note-func> is the PostScript function called at each note.
		<bar-func> is the PostScript function called at each bar.

	The arguments of the PostScript functions depend on the pitch
	presence.
	When the pitch is absent, the stack contains:
		- head function:
			- the music line width,
			- the x and y offsets,
			- the number of w: lines.
		- note function:
			- the string as defined by the 'w:' line.
			- the x and y offsets.
			- the w: line number (0 .. n-1).
		- bar function:
			- the ABC bar as a string.
			- the x and y offsets.
			- the w: line number (0 .. n-1).
	Otherwise (pitch present), the PS origins are translated to
	the tablature area and the stack contains:
		- head function:
			- the instrument pitch with a single uppercase
			  letter and a sharp or flat.
		- note function:
			- the octave (0 is 'C') letting pitch >= 0 and < 36
			- the pitch in 12th of octave on 3 octaves (0..35 -
				not integer when microtone)
			- the x offset
		- the bar function is never called.

	For examples of tablatures without pitch, see:
		'accordion.abc'
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/banjo.abc',
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/bataille.abc'
		'http://moinejf.free.fr/abc/tabyf1.abc'
	For examples of tablatures with pitch, look at
		flute.fmt
	and try:
		abcm2ps sample.abc -e1 -F flute.fmt -T1 -T3

  text <line of text>
	Print one line of text with the current value of '%%textoption'.

  vskip <h>
	Skip vertical space of height <h>.
