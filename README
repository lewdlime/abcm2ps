# abcm2ps version 8.x.x

## Overview
---

abcm2ps is a program which converts music tunes from ABC format to PostScript or SVG. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5 (see [Contacts](#contacts) below), it was developped mainly to print barock organ scores which have independant voices played on one or many keyboards and a pedal-board (the '`m`' of abcm2ps stands for many or multi staves/voices).

## Features
---

The main features of abcm2ps are quite the same as the abc2ps ones, but they are closer to the ABC standard 2.2 (February 2013):

## Installation and usage
---

The installation procedure is described in the file [`INSTALL`](./INSTALL).

Basically, the program usage is:

    abcm2ps [options] file1 [file1_options] file2 [file2_options] ...

where `file1, file2, ..` are the ABC input files. This will generate a Postscript file (default name: '`Out.ps`'. Run '`abcm2ps -h`' to know the list of the command line options).

## Documentation
---

- [`options.txt`](./options.txt) contains the list of the command line options.
- The format parameters are described in: [moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html](http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html)
- The differences from the current ABC standard are described in: [moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html](http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html)

## Differences with abc2ps
---

- The algorithms relative to voice and staff handling are different and may give better or worse results depending on the tunes.
- abcm2ps does not print the list of tunes and has different filtering functions. On the command line:
    - '`-o`' is implicit
    - '`-e`' accepts only one parameter.
    - '`-C`', '`-R`', '`-S`', '`-T`' don't exist anymore. If you want such filtering, you should to use some external script or program instead.
- There is no interactive mode ('`-i`').
- The scale is global (it was restricted to the music part in abc2ps).
- The characters '`\\`' don't do a line break.
- In landscape format, the values of '`pagewidth`' and '`pageheight`' are internally exchanged, so there is no need to set them explicitely.
- The format '`staffwidth`' is obsolete. Use '`pagewidth`' instead.
- Look also in the file '[`sample.abc`](./sample.abc)' for other incompatibilities.

## Limits
---

Many limits may be changed at compilation time (number of voices, staves, ..).
